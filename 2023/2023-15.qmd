## --- Day 15: Lens Library ---

A reindeer needs your help to process the Holiday ASCII String Helper algorithm.

Run the HASH algorithm on each step in the initialization sequence. *What is the sum of the results?* (The initialization sequence is one long line; be careful when copy-pasting it.)

```{python}

with open('data-2023-15.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}

mult = 17
div = 256
summer = 0


for i in inp:
    val = 0
    for j in i: 
        val += ord(j)
        val *= mult
        val = val % div
    summer += val
    
summer

# 510388

```

## --- Part Two ---

There is a second part to the instructions, of course.

With the help of an over-enthusiastic reindeer in a hard hat, follow the initialization sequence. *What is the focusing power of the resulting lens configuration?*

```{python}


```
