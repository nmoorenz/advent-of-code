## --- Day 20: Pulse Propagation ---

There are some complicated rules for signals and outputs and button presses.

Consult your module configuration; determine the number of low pulses and high pulses that would be sent after pushing the button `1000` times, waiting for all pulses to be fully handled after each push of the button. *What do you get if you multiply the total number of low pulses sent by the total number of high pulses sent?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-20.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```
