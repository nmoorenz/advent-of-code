## --- Day 19: Aplenty ---

We need to sort out some parts with x, m, a, s designations. Christmas, get it?

Sort through all of the parts you've been given; *what do you get if you add together all of the rating numbers for all of the parts that ultimately get accepted?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-19.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```

Paste part two here
