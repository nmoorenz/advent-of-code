## --- Day 22: Sand Slabs ---

There are some falling blocks of sand and we need to disintegrate them into actual sand.

Figure how the blocks will settle based on the snapshot. Once they've settled, consider disintegrating a single brick; *how many bricks could be safely chosen as the one to get disintegrated?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-22.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```

Paste part two here
