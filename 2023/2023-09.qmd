## --- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---

*Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor*

Analyze your OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for each history. *What is the sum of these extrapolated values?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-09.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Looooops

```{python}

oasis = [list(map(int, x.split())) for x in inp]

summer = 0

# go through the list
for o in oasis: 
    # print(o)
    # collect some other lists, until we reach zeros
    cll = []
    # the first list in our collection is the original list
    cll.append(o)
    # loop through while we don't have zeros
    while not all([x == 0 for x in cll[-1]]):
        # create a new list of differences
        dd = [q - p for p,q in zip(cll[-1], cll[-1][1:])]
        # add it in 
        cll.append(dd)
        # print(dd)

    # let's go back through this list, I think
    # add the previous number from one list to the next
    u = 0
    for r in cll[::-1]:
        u += r[-1]
    # keep track of everything
    # print(u)
    summer += u
        
summer

```

## --- Part Two ---

Analyze your OASIS report again, this time extrapolating the *previous* value for each history. *What is the sum of these extrapolated values?*

This took about two minutes! Sometimes you stumble on something nice.

```{python}


oasis = [list(map(int, x.split())) for x in inp]

summer = 0

# go through the list
for o in oasis: 
    # print(o)
    # collect some other lists, until we reach zeros
    cll = []
    # the first list in our collection is the original list
    cll.append(o)
    # loop through while we don't have zeros
    while not all([x == 0 for x in cll[-1]]):
        # create a new list of differences
        dd = [q - p for p,q in zip(cll[-1], cll[-1][1:])]
        # add it in 
        cll.append(dd)
        # print(dd)

    # let's go back through this list, I think
    # add the previous number from one list to the next
    u = 0
    for r in cll[::-1]:
        u = r[0] - u
        # print(u)
    # keep track of everything
    # print(u)
    summer += u
        
summer    

# 1057
```
