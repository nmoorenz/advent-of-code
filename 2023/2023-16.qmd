## --- Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava ---

Further into the facility, there is a beam of light and some more mirrors.

The light isn't energizing enough tiles to produce lava; to debug the contraption, you need to start by analyzing the current situation. With the beam starting in the top-left heading right, *how many tiles end up being energized?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-16.txt', 'r') as f:
# with open('data-2023-16-test.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

# for i in inp:
#     print(len(i))

```

Follow the lasers

```{python}

import numpy as np

laser = np.array([list(i) for i in inp])

# create a tracking array of the same size
track = np.zeros((len(laser), len(laser[0])), dtype=int)

# initial location and direction
# start at the top-left from the left and heading right
x = 0
y = 0
dx = 1
dy = 0

track[x,y] = 1

# when we split, how do we manage that? 

# need to manage changes of direction with angled mirrors i.e. \ and /
# need to manage splits with perpendicular approaches 
# dots and straight through have no effect but count those as energised



```
