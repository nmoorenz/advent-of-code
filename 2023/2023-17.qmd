## --- Day 17: Clumsy Crucible ---

We need to carry lava in a crucible through a city.

Directing the crucible from the lava pool to the machine parts factory, but not moving more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction, *what is the least heat loss it can incur?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-17.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

This seems like a simple optimisation problem but the restriction makes it weird.

From a manual inspection of the input we should generally avoid the middle of the city, there are lots of 8 and 9 in the middle.

Should I plot a random course and try to improve it? A greedy path for one or two steps then look around more?

```{python}

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

blocks = np.array([list(map(int, i)) for i in inp])

plt.imshow(blocks, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()

```
