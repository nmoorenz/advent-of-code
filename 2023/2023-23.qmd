## --- Day 23: A Long Walk ---

Let's go for a walk around Snow Island!

Find the longest hike you can take through the hiking trails listed on your map. *How many steps long is the longest hike?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-23.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```

Paste part two here
