## --- Day 6: Wait For It ---

Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. *What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?*

```{python}

with open('data-2023-06.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

Time = inp[0].split()[1:]
Distance = inp[1].split()[1:]

Time = [int(x) for x in Time]
Distance = [int(x) for x in Distance]
```

This seems straightforward - solved on google sheets to start with.

```{python}

# this is our answer, multiplied together
mult = 1

for d,t in zip(Distance, Time):
    # count of choices that make it past the distance
    cnt = 0
    # pretty sure it's not going to matter that we don't use the last one
    for x in range(t):
        z = (t - x) * x
        if z > d:
            cnt += 1
    # once we've gone through, multiply
    mult *= cnt
    
mult
```

## --- Part Two ---

Actually there was only one race

*How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?*

```{python}

Time = int(''.join(inp[0].split()[1:]))
Distance = int(''.join(inp[1].split()[1:]))

# count of choices that make it past the distance
cnt = 0

# pretty sure it's not going to matter that we don't use the last one
for x in range(0, Time, 1):
    z = (Time - x) * x
    if z > Distance:
        cnt += 1
        
cnt
```
