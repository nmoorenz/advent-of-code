## --- Day 5: Binary Boarding ---

You dropped your boarding pass, and now have to find your seat.

As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?

```{python}

with open('data-2020-05.txt', 'r') as f:
    bp = f.read().splitlines()

```

This is weird data but a short solution

```{python}

# row and col binary via replacement
row = [x[:7].replace("B", "1").replace("F", "0") for x in bp]
col = [x[7:].replace("L", "0").replace("R", "1") for x in bp]

# id as a combo of row and col            
id = [int(r, 2) * 8 + int(c, 2) for r, c in zip(row, col)]

#part a
max(id)

```

## --- Part Two ---

You have to find your seat number, quick!

*What is the ID of your seat?*

```{python}
# part b
set(range(min(id), max(id))) - set(id)
```
