## Advent of Code 2020

We're going on a holiday! 

### Day 1

1. Find two entries that sum to 2020
2. Three entries that sum to 2020

* This could be more efficient in R but I don't know how to break out of a double loop.     
* While searching for loop options in python I found three different ways to write the answer.    

### Day 2

1. How many valid passwords? Number of letters is given
2. How many valid, but the position of the letters is given 

* At first `str_split()` and `unnest_wider()` seemed like the way to go but `separate()` is much better.
* `pmap()` really takes care of business after defining a check function
* Lists can take care of many things in python, especially with the asterisk operator
* Multiple returns from functions are great

### Day 3

1. Trees grow weirdly; how many do you hit when riding on your toboggan? Right 3, down 1
2. There are different ways of getting down - multiply them all

* We don't need to replicate and create a huge matrix or dataframe, using modulo is much simpler
* This might be my favourite code from the advent
