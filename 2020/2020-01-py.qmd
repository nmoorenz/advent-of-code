## --- Day 1: Report Repair ---

The elves give you an expense report and need you to fix things up.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. *Find the two entries that sum to `2020`; what do you get if you multiply them together?*

```{python}

import itertools

with open('data-2020-01.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Loop through

```{python}

# want integer not strings
my_input = [int(i) for i in inp]

# probably a good idea
my_input.sort()

# for loops
for x in my_input:
  for y in my_input:
    if x + y == 2020:
      print(x * y)
      
```

## --- Part Two ---

Actually, find three numbers that sum to 2020.

In your expense report, *what is the product of the three entries that sum to `2020`?*

```{python}

# itertools
for x, y in itertools.product(my_input, my_input):
  if x + y == 2020:
    print(x * y)
    break

# generator
for x, y in ((xx, yy) for xx in my_input for yy in my_input):
  if x + y == 2020:
    print(x * y)
    break

# triple threat
for x, y, z in itertools.product(my_input, my_input, my_input):
  if x + y + z == 2020:
    print(x * y * z)
    break

```

```{python}

def find_sum_combs(inputs, total=2020, n=2):
    for comb in itertools.combinations(inputs, n):
        if sum(comb) == total:
            return comb
            

x, y = find_sum_combs(my_input)
print(x*y)

x, y, z = find_sum_combs(my_input, n=3)
print(x*y*z)

```
