## --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---

The toboggan you hire does not have much (any) steering.

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, *how many trees would you encounter?*

```{python}

with open('data-2020-03.txt', 'r') as f:
    course = f.read().splitlines()

```

Write a function

```{python}
  
# function for riding the toboggan
def move_tobog(rght, dwn, course):
  x_pos = 0
  y_pos = 0
  trees = 0
  course_len = len(course)
  course_wid = len(course[0])
  while y_pos < course_len:
    if course[y_pos][x_pos] == "#":
      trees += 1
    x_pos = (x_pos + rght) % course_wid
    y_pos = y_pos + dwn
  return trees
 
trees_1 = move_tobog(3, 1, course)

```

## --- Part Two ---

Can we find the best way to get down?

*What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?*

```{python}

# gather the different number of trees for the course movements
trees_2 = move_tobog(1, 1, course)
trees_3 = move_tobog(5, 1, course)
trees_4 = move_tobog(7, 1, course)
trees_5 = move_tobog(1, 2, course)

# part two answer
trees_1 * trees_2 * trees_3 * trees_4 * trees_5

```
