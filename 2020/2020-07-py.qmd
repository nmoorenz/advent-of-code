## --- Day 7: Handy Haversacks ---

Aviation rules are being enforced about bags and bags inside bags etcetera.

*How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?* (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)

```{python}

with open('data-2020-07.txt', 'r') as f:
    bags = f.read().splitlines()


# my main bag  
my_bag = "shiny gold"

```

Maybe write an explanation of the solution approach here

```{python}

# function for splitting 
def bags_split(rr):
  first, other = rr.split(' bags contain ')
  other_bags = other.split(',')
  return first, other_bags

# list of the bags information
bags_list = [bags_split(bb) for bb in bags]


```

## --- Part Two ---

*How many individual bags are required inside your single `shiny gold` bag?*
