## --- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---

You've got too many Aunt Sue and need to find the right one to thank them.

What is the *number* of the Sue that got you the gift?

```{python}

with open('data-2015-16.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Preparation

```{python}

tape = """children: 3
          cats: 7
          samoyeds: 2
          pomeranians: 3
          akitas: 0
          vizslas: 0
          goldfish: 5
          trees: 3
          cars: 2
          perfumes: 1"""

tape = tape.split('\n')
tape = [x.split(': ') for x in tape]
taped = {x[0].strip(): int(x[1]) for x in tape}
taped

```

Sue information

```{python}

sue = [x.split(': ', 1) for x in inp]
sue = {x[0]: x[1].split(', ') for x in sue}

for k,v in sue.items():
    sue[k] = {}
    for x in [m.strip() for m in v]:
        a,b = x.split(': ')
        sue[k].update({a: int(b)})
        
```

Now for the comparison

```{python}

for k,v in sue.items():
    found = 0
    for a,b in v.items():
        if b != taped[a]:
            # it's not this sue
            break
        else:
            # keep going
            found += 1
            if found == 3:
                print(k)
                print(v)

# 213
```

## --- Part Two ---

Actually, the numbers are different, so do some greater than and less than operations.

What is the *number* of the real Aunt Sue?

```{python}

_eq = ['children', 'samoyeds', 'akitas', 'vizslas', 'cars', 'perfumes', ]

_gt = ['cats', 'trees', ]

_lt = ['pomeranians', 'goldfish', ]

# same basic structure as before
for k,v in sue.items():
    found = 0
    for a,b in v.items():
        if a in _eq:
            if b != taped[a]:
                # it's not this sue
                break
            else:
                # keep going
                found += 1
        elif a in _gt: 
            if b <= taped[a]:
                break
            else: 
                found += 1
        elif a in _lt:
            if b >= taped[a]:
                break
            else:
                found += 1
    if found == 3:
        print(k)
        print(v)

# 323
```
