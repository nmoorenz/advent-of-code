## --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---

Santa is delivering presents in a large apartment building, but the lifts are a bit screwy.

To *what floor* do the instructions take Santa?

```{python}

with open('data-2015-01.txt', 'r') as f:
    paren = f.read()

```

Simple enough, count the ups and downs.

```{python}

paren.count('(') - paren.count(')')

# 137
```

## --- Part Two ---

What is the *position* of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?

```{python}
i = 0
santa = 0
p = list(paren)
while santa >= 0: 
    # move santa
    if p[i] == '(':
        santa += 1
    else:
        santa -= 1
    # increment
    i += 1
    
print(i)

# 1771

```
