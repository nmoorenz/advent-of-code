## --- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves need to order some wrapping paper, luckily they are all cube-ish.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total *square feet of wrapping paper* should they order?

```{python}

with open('data-2015-02.txt', 'r') as f:
    pres = f.read().splitlines()

```

Split into separate pieces for the different dimensions - try lists first? Do some calculations - we need area, minimum area, and then sum

```{python}

pres_dim = [[int(y) for y in p.split('x')] for p in pres]

for y in pres_dim:
    y.append(2 * y[0] * y[1])
    y.append(2 * y[1] * y[2])
    y.append(2 * y[0] * y[2])
    y.append(min(y[3], y[4], y[5])/2)
    y.append(y[3] + y[4] + y[5] + y[6])

```

Now to do a sum of the last elements of the lists

```{python}

sum(x[7] for x in pres_dim)

# 1586300

```

## --- Part Two ---

We also need some ribbon for the presents!

How many total *feet of ribbon* should they order?

```{python}

pres_dim = [[int(y) for y in p.split('x')] for p in pres]

for y in pres_dim:
    y.append(2 * y[0] + 2 * y[1]) 
    y.append(2 * y[1] + 2 * y[2])
    y.append(2 * y[0] + 2 * y[2])
    y.append(min(y[3], y[4], y[5]))
    y.append(y[0] * y[1] * y[2])
    y.append(y[6] + y[7]) 

```

And sum up the ribbon lengths :)

```{python}

sum(x[8] for x in pres_dim)

# 3737498

```
