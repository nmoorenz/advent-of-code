## --- Day 15: Science for Hungry People ---

Let's make some cookies!

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the *total score* of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?

```{python}

with open('data-2015-15.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

`split()` this into dictionaries

```{python}

# lists to start
ingr = [x.split(':') for x in inp]

print(ingr)

# dictionary, probably
ing = {x[0]: x[1].split(',') for x in ingr}

for k,v in ing.items():
    ing[k] = {}
    for x in [m.strip() for m in v]:
        a,b = x.split()
        ing[k].update({a: int(b)})


print()
print(ing)

```

That may have been too much, but there it is.

Now we need to know how much of each thing to include in our cookies.

How many ways are there to have four ingredients that add to 100?

```{python}

import itertools

counter = []

for g,h,i,j in itertools.product(range(101),
                                 range(101),
                                 range(101),
                                 range(101)):
    if g + h + i + j == 100:
        counter.append([g,h,i,j])

len(counter)

```

Takes a bit of time but that's fine, I think?

Sweet! Hopefully, we want to make delicious cookies.

```{python}

score = 0

ings = list(ing.keys())
prop = list(ing['Sprinkles'].keys())[:-1]

for c in counter:
    s = [0,0,0,0]
    for e,i in enumerate(ings):
        for f,p in enumerate(prop):
            s[f] += ing[i][p] * c[e]
            
    sc = max(0,s[0]) * max(0,s[1]) * max(0,s[2]) * max(0,s[3])
    if sc > score:
        # print(sc)
        # print(s)
        score = sc

print(score)

# 21367368

```

## --- Part Two ---

But wait, there's a change!

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the *total score* of the highest-scoring cookie you can make with a calorie total of `500`?

```{python}

score = 0
z = 'calories'

ings = list(ing.keys())
prop = list(ing['Sprinkles'].keys())[:-1]

for c in counter:
    s = [0,0,0,0]
    for e,i in enumerate(ings):
        for f,p in enumerate(prop):
            s[f] += ing[i][p] * c[e]
    # check scores and calories    
    sc = max(0,s[0]) * max(0,s[1]) * max(0,s[2]) * max(0,s[3])
    cal = sum([ing[i][z] * c[e] for e,i in enumerate(ings)])
    if sc > score and cal == 500:
        score = sc

print(score)

# 1766400

```
