## --- Day 16: Reindeer Maze ---

Find the path from the start to the end, except that turns cost you 1000 points.

Analyze your map carefully.Â What is the lowest score a Reindeer could possibly get?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2024-16.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

maze_list = [list(x) for x in inp]

maze = np.array(maze_list)

```

Try to go through the maze, but need to find a weird way of doing so.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```
