## --- Day 10: Hoof It ---

A reindeer has a map of a hiking trail.

The reindeer gleefully carries over a protractor and adds it to the pile.Â What is the sum of the scores of all trailheads on your topographic map?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2024-10.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

trail = [list(map(int,x)) for x in inp]

trail = np.array(trail)
```

Find the zeros and do a search through all the different paths.

```{python}

counter = 0
q = 59

zero = np.where(trail == '0')

zero = [[a,b] for a,b in zip(zero[0],zero[1])]

# zero

def get_d(z):
    dd = [[-1,0],[0,-1],[1,0],[0,1]]
    if z[0] == 0: 
        dd.remove([-1,0])
    elif z[0] == q:
        dd.remove([1,0])
    elif z[1] == 0:
        dd.remove([0,-1])
    elif z[1] == q:
        dd.remove([0,1])
    else: 
        pass # leave all
    return dd


def find_paths(z): 
    dd = get_d(z)
    paths = 0
    for d in dd: 
        if trail[z[0]+d[0]][z[1]+d[1]] == trail[z[0]][z[1]] + 1:
            pass # continue
        else: 
            print(z)
    return 0
    
    
for z in zero:
    counter += find_paths(z)
     
            
counter

```
