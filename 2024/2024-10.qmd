## --- Day 10: Hoof It ---

A reindeer has a map of a hiking trail.

The reindeer gleefully carries over a protractor and adds it to the pile.Â What is the sum of the scores of all trailheads on your topographic map?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2024-10.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

trail = [list(x) for x in inp]

trail_map = np.array(trail)
```

Find the zeros and do a search through all the different paths.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```
