## --- Day 24: Crossed Wires ---

There are some gates and some wires and some logic, and we want to produce a number.

Simulate the system of gates and wires. What decimal number does it output on the wires starting with `z`?

```{python}

with open('data-2024-24.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

init = inp[:90]
log = inp[91:]

```

Create dictionaries to keep track of these things. Actually a dict and a list.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

di = {}

for i in init: 
    a,b = i.split(': ')
    di[a] = int(b)
    
dl = [i.split() for i in log]

```

Now we need to go through with some smart order. Start with x and y?

Examples

```         
['qgv', 'OR', 'dsf', '->', 'mjm'] 
['shj', 'AND', 'wsr', '->', 'ftr']
```

```{python}

def combo(x): 
    if x[1] == 'XOR': 
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] == 1:
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    elif x[1] == 'OR':
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] >= 1: 
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    elif x[1] == 'AND':
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] == 2:
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    else: 
        raise


for d in dl: 
    if ((d[0][0] == 'x' or d[0][0] == 'y') and 
        (d[2][0] == 'x' or d[2][0] == 'y')):
        # add to the dictionary with the operation
        # print(d)
        di[d[4]] = combo(d)
    
```
