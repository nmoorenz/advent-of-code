## --- Day 24: Crossed Wires ---

There are some gates and some wires and some logic, and we want to produce a number.

Simulate the system of gates and wires. What decimal number does it output on the wires starting with `z`?

```{python}

with open('data-2024-24.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

init = inp[:90]
log = inp[91:]

```

Create dictionaries to keep track of these things. Actually a dict and a list.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

di = {}

for i in init: 
    a,b = i.split(': ')
    di[a] = int(b)
    
dl = [i.split() for i in log]

```

Now we need to go through with some smart order. Start with x and y?

Examples

```         
['qgv', 'OR', 'dsf', '->', 'mjm'] 
['shj', 'AND', 'wsr', '->', 'ftr']
```

```{python}

def combo(x): 
    if x[1] == 'XOR': 
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] == 1:
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    elif x[1] == 'OR':
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] >= 1: 
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    elif x[1] == 'AND':
        if di[x[0]] + di[x[2]] == 2:
            return 1
        else: 
            return 0
    else: 
        raise

while True: 
    for d in dl: 
        if d[0] in di.keys() and d[2] in di.keys(): 
            di[d[4]] = combo(d)
    break

len(di)   

# actually just run this a bunch of times
# until the length doesn't change
# 312 length 
```

get the z

```{python}

zz = []

# only get the z, combined into list
for k,v in di.items(): 
    if k[0] == 'z': 
        # print(k,v)
        zz.append(' '.join([k,str(v)]))

# check
zz
# sort in order
zz.sort()
# split and get the numbers
znum = [x.split()[1] for x in zz]
# check
znum
# join and reverse the string
zbin = ''.join(znum)[::-1]
# convert binary to integer
int(zbin, 2)

# 5063606933169
# 38869984335432

```

## --- Part Two ---

Actually, we are trying to add x digits and y digits, but the system isn't working properly. What do you get if you sort the names of the eight wires involved in a swap and then join those names with commas?

```{python}



```
