## --- Day 23: LAN Party ---

Find all the sets of three inter-connected computers.Â How many contain at least one computer with a name that starts with `t`?

```{python}

with open('data-2024-23.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

comps = [i.split('-') for i in inp]
```

I think just create some ordered lists?

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

links = []

links.append(comps[0])

for c in comps[1:]: 
    # print(c)
    for l in links: 
        # print(l)
        if c[0] in l: 
            # add it to something
            if c[1] not in l: 
                l.append(c[1])
        elif c[1] in l:
            if c[0] not in l: 
                l.append(c[0])
        else: 
            links.append(c)
            break
    # print('---links ', links)


# lens = [len(l) for l in links]
# 
# for j,k in zip(lens,links): 
#     if j != 2: 
#         print(k)

# for a in links[0]:
#     if a in links[1]: 
#         print('uh-oh')
        
```

There are many uh-oh because there are loops of many and computers show up in many links.

I think sets of three are just going to show up three times in the whole thing.

```{python}

counts = []

for c in comps: 
    a,b = c
    ax = 0
    bx = 0
    for d in comps: 
        if c != d: 
            if a in d: 
                ax += 1
            if b in d: 
                bx += 1
    if ax == 12: 
        print(a)
    if bx == 4: 
        print(b)
    if ax not in counts: 
        counts.append(ax)
    if bx not in counts: 
        counts.append(bx)
        
# len(counts)

```
