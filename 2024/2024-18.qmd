## --- Day 18: RAM Run ---

You are inside a computer, with bytes falling down.

Simulate the first kilobyte (`1024` bytes) falling onto your memory space. Afterward, what is the minimum number of steps needed to reach the exit?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2024-18.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

bytes = [[int(x.split(',')[0]), int(x.split(',')[1])] for x in inp]

```

Create a grid, fill that grid with first bunch of corruption.

```{python}

p1_bytes = bytes[:1024]

ram = np.full((71,71), '.')

for p in p1_bytes: 
    ram[p[0],p[1]] = '#'
    

np.savetxt('ram_bytes.txt', ram, delimiter='', fmt='%s')

```

How do I now solve for shortest path?

```{python}


```
