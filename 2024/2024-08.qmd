## --- Day 8: Resonant Collinearity ---

Antinodes make people buy inferior easter bunny chocolate.

Calculate the impact of the signal.Â How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2024-08.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

nodes = [list(x) for x in inp]

antenna = np.array(nodes)

# len(antenna)
# len(antenna[0])

all_char = list(set([x for i in inp for x in i]))
all_char.sort()
# all_char

char_count = np.unique(antenna, return_counts=True)

# np.array(char_count).T
```

Guess I have to loop through these? It's not so many.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```
