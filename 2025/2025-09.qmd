## --- Day 9: Movie Theater ---

There are some interesting tiles on a movie theater floor.

Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make?

```{python}

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


with open('data-2025-09.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

tiles = [[int(x.split(',')[0]), int(x.split(',')[1])] for x in inp]


```

Calculate all the combinations and record the maximum

```{python}

maxim = 0

for i in tiles: 
    for j in tiles: 
        area = (max(i[0], j[0]) - min(i[0], j[0]) + 1) * \
               (max(i[1], j[1]) - min(i[1], j[1]) + 1)
        if area > maxim: 
            maxim = area
            
maxim

```

## --- Part Two ---

The area can only have red or green tiles, i.e. contain other areas within it.

Using two red tiles as opposite corners, *what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make using only red and green tiles?*

I think we are going to have to create an array with these tiles, and then test things out. Can we be efficient with that? Maybe.

```{python}

recs = np.zeros((99999,99999), dtype='i1')

for e, t in enumerate(tiles[:10]):
    recs[t[0], t[1]] = 1
    s = tiles[e-1]
    if s[0] == t[0]: 
        y = min(s[1], t[1])
        z = max(s[1], t[1])
        for k in range(y, z):
            recs[t[0], k] = 1
    else: 
        y = min(s[0], t[0])
        z = max(s[0], t[0])
        for k in range(y, z):
            recs[k, t[1]] = 1
        
# 97633,51388 check for lines

recs[97630:97640, 51385:51392]

```

Prepare the inner parts

```{python}


# for c in range(99999):
#     for d in range(99999):
for c in range(97630, 97640):
    for d in range(51385, 51392):        
        if recs[c,d] == 1:
            pass # already one
        elif (sum(recs[0:c, d]) % 2) == 0: 
            pass
        elif (sum(recs[c:99999, d]) % 2) == 0: 
            pass
        elif (sum(recs[c, 0:d]) % 2) == 0: 
            pass
        elif (sum(recs[c, d:99999]) % 2) == 0: 
            pass
        else: 
            recs[c,d] = 1

recs[97630:97640, 51385:51392]

```

This isn't working.

Hint from Reddit: compress the corrdinates. Let's write a thing to see what the gaps are and if we can reduce the size of the grid. Check all the differences.

```{python}

c1 = {}
c2 = {}

for e, t in enumerate(tiles):
    s = tiles[e-1]
    if s[0] == t[0]: 
        # add to c2
        cn = abs(s[1] - t[1])
        if cn in c2.keys(): 
            c2[cn] += 1
        else: 
            c2[cn] = 1
    else: 
        # add to c1
        cn = abs(s[0] - t[0])
        if cn in c1.keys(): 
            c1[cn] += 1
        else: 
            c1[cn] = 1
        
c1
c2
```

Okay, there's no consistency here that I can immediately see.

```{python}


x = [t[0] for t in tiles]
y = [t[1] for t in tiles]

# plt.scatter(x, y)
# ax = plt.gca()
# ax.set_xlim([90000, 100000])
# ax.set_ylim([45000, 55000])
# plt.show()

xx = np.vstack([x[0:-1:1],x[1::1]])
yy = np.vstack([y[0:-1:1],y[1::1]])
plt.plot(xx,yy, '-o')
# plt.axis('auto')
ax = plt.gca()
# ax.set_xlim([0, 10000])
# ax.set_ylim([45000, 55000])
ax.set_xlim([90000, 100000])
ax.set_ylim([45000, 55000])
plt.show()

# line, = ax.plot(x, y, 'ro-')

```

Okay, so, there's a minimum limit for the y values, can we just put that in our loop for part one? Probably

The weird jump in the data:

94553,50158

94553,48602

We can have regions above or below the gap! Not just to the right hand side of it. Obviously.

In fact, it's only going to be above or below, so we only need to test \< 48602 with each other and \> 50158 with each other.

```{python}

maxim = 0

for i in tiles: 
    for j in tiles: 
        if i[1] <= 48602 and j[1] <= 48602: 
            area = (max(i[0], j[0]) - min(i[0], j[0]) + 1) * \
                   (max(i[1], j[1]) - min(i[1], j[1]) + 1)
            if area > maxim: 
                maxim = area
        elif i[1] >= 50158 and j[1] >= 50158: 
            area = (max(i[0], j[0]) - min(i[0], j[0]) + 1) * \
                   (max(i[1], j[1]) - min(i[1], j[1]) + 1)
            if area > maxim: 
                maxim = area
        else: 
            # opposite sides of the divide
            pass
        
maxim

# 73143488 too low
# 3078193230 too high
```

Attempt 3 (of this phase): there are individual ins and outs around the place.

We could create a list of valid points by creating a new circle with simple up / down / left / right movements.
