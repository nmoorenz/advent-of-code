## --- Day 4: Printing Department ---

There are lots of large paper rolls everywhere. We need to organise the forklifts to pick some up.

Consider your complete diagram of the paper roll locations. How many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift?

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2025-04.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

lists = [list(i) for i in inp]

roll = np.array(lists)
```

140 x 140 grid

Numpy for an array, I guess

```{python}

summer = 0

for i in range(140): 
    for j in range(140):
        if roll[i,j] == '@':
            # make sure of our indices
            a = 0 if i == 0 else 1
            c = 0 if j == 0 else 1
            b = 1 if i == 139 else 2
            d = 1 if j == 139 else 2
            # a little easier for our object 
            assess = roll[i-a:i+b, j-c:j+d]
            # assess
            if np.count_nonzero(assess == '@') - 1 < 4: 
                # remove the current roll
                summer += 1
                
summer

# 411 too low
# 1569 

```

## --- Part Two ---

The forklifts are going to remove the rolls of paper.

Start with your original diagram. How many rolls of paper in total can be removed by the Elves and their forklifts?

We need to alter the original array to remove rolls as we go along within a while loop.

```{python}

summer = 0
roll = np.array(lists)
iterations = 0

while True: 
    iterations += 1
    if iterations > 50: break # safety
    
    for i in range(140): 
        for j in range(140):
            if roll[i,j] == '@':
                # make sure of our indices
                a = 0 if i == 0 else 1
                c = 0 if j == 0 else 1
                b = 1 if i == 139 else 2
                d = 1 if j == 139 else 2
                # a little easier for our object 
                assess = roll[i-a:i+b, j-c:j+d]
                # assess
                if np.count_nonzero(assess == '@') - 1 < 4: 
                    # remove the current roll
                    roll[i,j] = '.'
                    summer += 1
                    
    summer
    
# 9280 

```
