## --- Day 3: Lobby ---

Fix the escalator with some battery power.

There are many batteries in front of you. Find the maximum joltage possible from each bank; what is the total output joltage?

```{python}

import re

with open('data-2025-03.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Can I just loop backwards from 99 and see what I can find? A little regex?

Alternatively: Find the highest number in the sequence that's not at the end, and then find the highest number after that. Which is really just two loops instead of one.

```{python}

summer = 0

for b in inp:
    for i in range(99, 9, -1): 
        # print(i)
        j = str(i)[0]
        k = str(i)[1]
        patt = '[' + j + '].*[' + k + ']'
        # print(patt)
        if re.search(patt, b) is not None: 
            summer += int(j+k)
            break
    
# 17412 

```

## --- Part Two ---

The battery's joltage is actually 12 digits, not two.

*What is the new total output joltage?*

This feels like the previous alternative is actually the right suggestion.

Find the highest number in the first 89 characters (lines are 100 characters long).

If the 89th character is a 9, and there are no 9s before that, then whatever comes after that is the largest number possible.

Need to find the position of the maximum, and then the next maximum from that position until L-10, and then the next from L-9, etcetera.

`max()` of a string works

```{python}

summer = 0

for b in inp[:1]: 
    curr = [] # current list of digits
    pos = -1
    for z in range(11, -1, -1): 
        px = pos + 1
        nxt = max(b[px:-z])
        pos = b[px:].find(nxt) + px
        print(nxt, pos, px)
        
```
