## --- Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone ---

You deploy some sensors to try to detect the distress signal beacon.

Consult the report from the sensors you just deployed. *In the row where `y=2,000,000`, how many positions cannot contain a beacon?*

```{python}

import re

with open('data-2022-15.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

The locations are way bigger in the actual input than the example! I'm not sure if an array is the way to go but we'll try anyway.

```{python}

m = r'Sensor at x=(\d+), y=(\d+)'

sensor = [[int(re.match(m, i)[1]), int(re.match(m, i)[2])]  for i in inp]

n = r'.* x=(-?\d+), y=(-?\d+)$'

beacon = [[int(re.match(n, i)[1]), int(re.match(n, i)[2])]  for i in inp]

```
