## --- Day 24: Blizzard Basin ---

We have to make our way through a blizzard. We can either wait, or move to where there is not a blizzard.

*What is the fewest number of minutes required to avoid the blizzards and reach the goal?*

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2022-24.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

bl = np.array([list(x) for x in inp])

```

This isn't a regular shortest path problem. I expect that there's only one way to go, or even very limited options.

```{python}
# here's another python cell for good luck

```
