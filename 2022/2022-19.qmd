## --- Day 19: Not Enough Minerals ---

Determine the quality level of each blueprint using the largest number of geodes it could produce in 24 minutes. *What do you get if you add up the quality level of all of the blueprints in your list?*

```{python}

with open('data-2022-19.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

Borrow this code from day 15 to get the information

```{python}

# Blueprint 1
b = r'Blueprint (\d+).*'
blueprint = [int(re.match(b, i)[1]) for i in inp] 
blueprint 

# ore robot costs 3 ore
c = r'.*ore robot costs (\d+).*'
ore = [int(re.match(c, i)[1])  for i in inp]
ore 

# clay robot costs 3 ore
d = r'.*clay robot costs (\d+).*'
clay = [int(re.match(d, i)[1])  for i in inp]
clay

# obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 20 clay
e = r'.*obsidian robot costs (\d+) ore and (\d+).*'
obs = [[int(re.match(e, i)[1]), int(re.match(e, i)[2])]  for i in inp]
obs

# geode robot costs 2 ore and 12 obsidian
f = r'.*geode robot costs (\d+) ore and (\d+).*'
geo = [[int(re.match(f, i)[1]), int(re.match(f, i)[2])]  for i in inp]
geo 

robots = [[x[0], x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]] 
               for x in zip(blueprint, ore, clay, obs, geo)]
               
```

Loop through these with the rules.

We start with one ore collecting robot. Assumption: we don't want to build any more ore collecting robots, because obsidian robots rely on clay and geode robots rely on obsidian. A good check will be if we have enough clay but not enough ore or if we have enough obsidian but not enough ore. Luckily we have a hierarchy of robots (this is bound to be a difficulty in part two).

```{python}

bank = {'oe': 0, 'cl': 0, 'ob': 0, 'ge': 0}

for r in robots: 
    for m in range(24): 
        pass
    
```
