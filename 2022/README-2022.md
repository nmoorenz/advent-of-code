## Advent of Code 2022

### Day 1

1.  Find the elf with the largest amount of calories
2.  Find the sum of the three largest amounts of calories

-   Add up the items, separated by blank lines
-   Sort the array from part one

### Day 2

1.  Follow a strategy guide for how to win at Rock Paper Scissors
2.  The strategy guide shows if you should win or lose

-   Create a function! Loop the things! 
-   Create a slightly different function :)

### Day 3

1.  Find the common letter between the first half and second half of a string
2.  Find the common letter between three sets of strings

-   `ord()` is a good function to give the score of a letter
-   We can operate on pandas dataframes as an interesting way to keep results organised
-   Love a good lambda function. 

### Day 4

1.  Find if one set of numbers is within another set
2.  Find if there are any overlap between the pairs of sets

-   Data preparation, and create a function
-   Create a slightly different function

### Day 5

1.  Move some crates around on stacks. Which crate ends up on top of each stack? 
2.  Move the crates around but they all get moved at once

-   Wrangle the data into a thoughtful organisation to enable stack movements
-   Make sure we follow instructions properly
-   Write a slightly different implementation of movement, which was actually what I did in the first step. 

### Day 6

1.  Loop through the input, and find four characters in a row that do not repeat
2.  Loop for fourteen unique characters

-   A set is a unique 'list', and if these are the same, we find what we want

### Day 7

1.  Find the total size of 'small' directories by going through the directory structure
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 8

1.  Find the trees that are visible from outside the grid 
2.  Find the tree with the best 'scenic score'

-   Work through the logic carefully, it probably could be a little function and list comp
-   A bit more complicated, so create a function to count trees and scores

### Day 9

1.  Move around a grid with tail following head
2.  Move around, but with a whole rope, ten units from head to tail

-   Move the head, create a function to check if the tail goes along too, record the results
-   Part two is much more difficult, with checking movement of all the pieces

### Day 10

1.  Loop through some instructions and record where we get to at 20 steps
2.  The instructions describe the pixels on a small screen, what does it say? 

-   Reasonably simple loop recording some values along the way
-   A little bit more complicated with the sprites and the cycles but ultimately OK

### Day 11

1.  Some monkeys are throwing your things around, keep track of them 
2.  Keep track of the things after many more rounds of throwing things. 

-   We're not meant to write the problem specification in public but I don't see a way around it
-   There are lots and lots of rules
-   I'm sure there's a pattern trick to this, the objects keep going through the same monkeys' hands, but just run for a long time.

### Day 12

1.  Three's a map of where you have to go, but can only go one step up at a time. 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 13

1.  The distress signals are all mixed up, which ones are in the correct order? 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 14

1.  There is sand dropping down in the cave - how much before it slips over the rocks? 
2.  There is a floor in the cave and much more sand falling down - how much more? 

-   It's important to set the problem up properly and make the cave look intuitive
-   Change the stopping conditions for part two and the final counter calculation. 

### Day 15

1.  Deploy some sensors and detect some beacons - how much space is covered in a particular row? 
2.  There is only one space where the distress beacon could be - where is it? 

-   Some nice regex for getting the locations of sensors and beacons
-   I have two gold stars but no other code? How did I figure this out? Did I not save properly? Ugh. 
-   

### Day 16

1.  Release some pressure in some valves - as much pressure as possible in 30 minutes. 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 17

1.  There are 2022 rocks falling down, getting moved about by some gas, how tall does the tower of rocks get? 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 18

1.  A funny shaped lava droplet might turn into obsidian! What's the surface area? 
2.  There are some internal air pockets and the surface area is actually less. 

-   Construct a nice array and count the sides. 
-   Create a different array and count the sides. 

### Day 19

1.  Construct some robots to gather ore, clay, obsidian, and geodes. 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 20

1.  You have a list of coordinates but need to decrypt the file by 'mixing'. 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 21

1.  The monkeys are yelling some numbers, you need to figure out the math
2.  You need to yell a number as well, and make the last two numbers match. 

-   I probably spent a while on this initially getting the calculations right
-   It's really fun to come back to and make improvements!
-   Part two could probably still be done better but it's fine with some manual loops. 

### Day 22

1.  The monkeys have a plan to get you through a weird map. Where do you end up? 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 23

1.  Help the elves spread apart to plant some trees. How far do they get after ten rounds? 
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 24

1.  Make your way through a blizzard, how many minutes does it take to get through?
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 25

1.  Figure out some weird base 5 math for the hot air balloon fuel to get outta here. 
2.
