## Advent of Code 2022

### Day 1

1.  Find the elf with the largest amount of calories
2.  Find the sum of the three largest amounts of calories

-   Add up the items, separated by blank lines
-   Sort the array from part one

### Day 2

1.  Follow a strategy guide for how to win at Rock Paper Scissors
2.  The strategy guide shows if you should win or lose

-   Create a function! Loop the things! 
-   Create a slightly different function :)

### Day 3

1.  Find the common letter between the first half and second half of a string
2.  Find the common letter between three sets of strings

-   `ord()` is a good function to give the score of a letter
-   We can operate on pandas dataframes as an interesting way to keep results organised
-   Love a good lambda function. 

### Day 4

1.  Find if one set of numbers is within another set
2.  Find if there are any overlap between the pairs of sets

-   Data preparation, and create a function
-   Create a slightly different function

### Day 5

1.  Move some crates around on stacks. Which crate ends up on top of each stack? 
2.  Move the crates around but they all get moved at once

-   Wrangle the data into a thoughtful organisation to enable stack movements
-   Make sure we follow instructions properly
-   Write a slightly different implementation of movement, which was actually what I did in the first step. 

### Day 6

1.  Loop through the input, and find four characters in a row that do not repeat
2.  Loop for fourteen unique characters

-   A set is a unique 'list', and if these are the same, we find what we want

### Day 7

1.  Find the total size of 'small' directories by going through the directory structure
2.  

-   
-   

### Day 8

1.  Find the trees that are visible from outside the grid 
2.  Find the tree with the best 'scenic score'

-   Work through the logic carefully, it probably could be a little function and list comp
-   A bit more complicated, so create a function to count trees and scores

### Day 9

1.  Move around a grid with tail following head
2.  Move around, but with a whole rope, ten units from head to tail

-   Move the head, create a function to check if the tail goes along too, record the results
-   Part two is much more difficult, with checking movement of all the pieces

### Day 10

1.  Loop through some instructions and record where we get to at 20 steps
2.  The instructions describe the pixels on a small screen, what does it say? 

-   Reasonably simple loop recording some values along the way
-   A little bit more complicated with the sprites and the cycles but ultimately OK
