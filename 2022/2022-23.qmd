## --- Day 23: Unstable Diffusion ---

We have to help the elves spread out to plant some trees.

Simulate the Elves' process and find the smallest rectangle that contains the Elves after 10 rounds. *How many empty ground tiles does that rectangle contain?*

```{python}

import numpy as np

with open('data-2022-23.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

len(inp)
len(inp[0])

elf = np.full((105,105), '.', dtype='U')

ee = [list(x) for x in inp]

for y in range(15,90): 
    elf[y, 15:90] = ee[y-15]

np.savetxt('data-2022-23-elves.txt', elf, fmt='%s', delimiter='')

```

We can set up an array to make sure we can expand - at most we can expand ten steps outwards in the first ten rounds, but suspect we will have to expand until there's no more moves in step two.

```{python}

moves = ['N', 'S', 'W', 'E', ]
move_check = {
    'N': [], 
    'S': [],
    'W': [],
    'E': [], 
    }

def do_we_move(i,j):
    ss = sum(elf[i-1:i+1,j-1:j+1] == '#') - 1
    if ss == 0: 
        return None
    else: 
        # decide where to move
        for m in moves: 
            for n in move_check[m]:
                print(n)
                return i,j
            
            
# main loop 
for r in range(10): 
    # loop through the elves
    for i in range(len(elf)): 
        for j in range(len(elf[0])): 
            if elf[i,j] == '#': 
                # decide if we should move
                mover = do_we_move(i,j)
    # check for any clashes
    
    # make the moves
    
                

```
