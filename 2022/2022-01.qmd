## --- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

We are going on a journey to collect some magical *star*Â fruit for the reindeer. The elves are carrying some rations for the journey.

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. *How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?*

```{python}

with open('data-2022-01.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

This looks like a loop to me

```{python}


cal = [0]

for i in inp:
    if i == '':
        cal.append(0)
    else:
        cal[-1] += int(i)

max(cal)

# 72511
```

## --- Part Two ---

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. *How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?*

```{python}

cal.sort()

cal[-3:]

sum(cal[-3:])

# 212117

```
