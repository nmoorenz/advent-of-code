## --- Day 20: Grove Positioning System ---

We're going to the grove where the star fruit grows, but we need to figure out where that is.

Mix your encrypted file exactly once. *What is the sum of the three numbers that form the grove coordinates?*

```{python}

with open('data-2022-20.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read().splitlines()

```

We need to keep track of the original order, and the list of numbers being mixed.

```{python}

orig = [int(x) for x in inp]
mix = [int(x) for x in inp]

# print(mix)

for o in orig: 
    # find the current position of this one in mix
    old_pos = mix.index(o)
    # print(o, old_pos)
    # work out the new index
    new_pos = old_pos + o
    if new_pos > len(orig): 
        new_pos = new_pos - len(orig) + 1
    if new_pos == 0: 
        new_pos = len(orig)
    # move
    mix.insert(new_pos, mix.pop(old_pos))
    # print to check
    # print(mix)
    
    
    
```

Work out position 1000, 2000, 3000 after the value 0.

```{python}

# answer counter
sums = 0

# location of zero
zz = mix.index(0)
# zz

# length of array for convenience
ll = len(mix)

# need each of these permissions
for ii in [1000, 2000, 3000]: 
    # don't need to loop, just find the position assuming we have looped around
    rr = ii % ll
    # can't be bigger than the array, take the length off
    # because we start from position 0
    rr += zz
    if rr > ll: 
        rr -= len(mix)
    # print and record
    # mix[rr]
    sums += mix[rr]

sums

# -9675 incorrect
# 3598 too low

```
