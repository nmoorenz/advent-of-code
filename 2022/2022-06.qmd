## --- Day 6: Tuning Trouble ---

We are on our way!

However, because he's heard you have [significant](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/6) [experience](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/25) [dealing](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7) [with](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9) [signal-based](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/16) [systems](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25), he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

*How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?*

```{python}

with open('data-2022-06.txt', 'r') as f:
    inp = f.read()

```

Loop and find four distinct in a row

```{python}

len(inp)

for i in range(3, len(inp)):
    t = inp[i-3:i+1]
    if sorted(list(t)) == sorted(list(set(t))):
        print(i+1)
        break

# 1896
```

## --- Part Two ---

Start-of-message markers are 14 unique characters.

*How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?*

```{python}

for i in range(14, len(inp)):
    t = inp[i-13:i+1]
    if sorted(list(t)) == sorted(list(set(t))):
        print(i+1)
        break

# 3452
```
