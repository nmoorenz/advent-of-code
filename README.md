Advent of Code: attempting to demonstrate some coding knowledge

This is primarily an RStudio Project, but can also be opened in VSCode, or whatever else.

-   Use `create-files.py` in combination with `template.qmd` to create the Quarto documents and input data files for each day in a year.

-   Use `get-input.py` or `get-all-input.py` to get input for puzzles.

For more on the mixture of code and prose, see [quarto.org](quarto.org)
